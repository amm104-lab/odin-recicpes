        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This custard recipe is a combination of a few different recipes I've tried. It's not too rich or too sweet as many egg custards can be. Can be served warm immediately or cold.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Milk</b>: 4 cups</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla extract</b>: 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li><b>Butter</b>: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: 4</li>
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: 1/2 cup</li>
        <li><b>Cornsarch</b>: 3 tablespoons</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering; remove from heat before it comes to a boil. </li> <br>
        <li>Whisk eggs, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li> <br>
        <li>Set the saucepan back over low heat. Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat the bottom of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. </li> <br>
        <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn. </li> <br>
        <li>Serve warm or transfer custard into a large bowl, cover, and allow to cool before chilling. </li> <br>
    </ol>
